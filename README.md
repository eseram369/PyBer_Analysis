# PyBer_Analysis
### Overview of the analysis
#### We need to create an overall picture of the ride-sharing data. We make scatter, and pie charts, a summary table of the ride-sharing has key metrics of the data by city type, and a multiple-line graph that shows the average fare for each week by each city type is required.

### Results
#### The data from the Summary DataFrame above shows that there are more drivers in the more populated cities. The Urban located cities have 13 times as many rides as the Rural Cities and 30 times as many drivers. Many more fares are collected in heavily populated areas, and the average fare per ride decreases by a whole $10 from a rural area to an urban area. The average fare of the driver was reduced by around $40. Even the suburban areas have two times fewer rides than the urban area and four times fewer drivers available.

#### When viewing the PyBer data by city type over time, we can see that the average total fare has a similar pattern over various months between January and April, with total fares peaking around March. Fares in urban cities again clearly lead the way in fares collected and bring in the most revenue for PyBer, followed by Suburban located cities and then Rural cities. Across the board, fares remain the lowest in January, slowly rise to a peak at the beginning of March, back down a little, and then slightly back up for Suburban areas in April.

### SummaryThey are three business recommendations that summarize to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

    - Focus selecting efforts on rural and suburban areas to increase the number of drivers in those areas.
   
    - Conduct Target advertising for both consumers and drivers (contractors) in rural and suburban areas.
    
    - Offer marketing incentives for consumers to order app-based driving in suburban and rural areas. Increase city workforce goes out and works in rural and suburban areas. Host job fairs and marketing events in rural and suburban areas.
